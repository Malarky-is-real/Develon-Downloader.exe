This is the exectutable for the Develon Downloader. 

The DD is able to download songs from Youtube and *Spotify from either the direct link or a playlist. 

Works better with Youtube than *spotify as it is currently unable to download directly from spotify and has to look up the title and download a video with a similar title. This can lead to issues such as one hour versions being downloaded and the wrong song being downloaded entirely. Will be further looked into.
